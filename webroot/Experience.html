                <p>Welcome to my Experience page!</p><br>
                <p>I have experience in being a leader as in my secondary school, I was a role model to younger students as I was headboy for my year.I also helped as a tutor teaching younger students maths.</p>
                <p>This has helped me mature as a person and understand what it takes to be a leader, which will be very helpful for my career if I plan on taking a managerial role in the future.</p>
                <p>I have also worked as a steward in stadiums such as the Emirates Stadium, where I have to work with other members in my team, which requires great team coordination to help keep your allocated area safe.</p>
                <p>This has helped me learn how to work better with others in my team which is a key asset when working with others in a group.</p>
