                <p>Welcome to my About Me page!</p><br>
                <p>My name is Kamal Maktari. I am 19 years old. I study Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London.</p>
                <p>I enjoy coding which is why I have decided to pursue it as a career. I also play many sports such as football, basketball, and swimming. I enjoy doing these activities with my friends.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy going out for a walk by my local park. I tend to this a lot during busy days of work. It helps me clear up my mind.</p>
