                <p>Welcome to my Skills and Achievements page!</p><br>
                <p>My skills are based around Computer Science. I have also achieved rewards for being a role model as while I was in secondary school, I was given opportunities to help younger students with their studies.</p>
                <p>I believe I'm also fantastic at working with others from jobs I've had in the past such as stewarding.</p>
