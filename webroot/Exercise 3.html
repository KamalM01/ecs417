        <p class="p1">I live in London which is a city in England.</p>
        <p class="p1">I enjoy living in London.</p>
        <p class="p1">This is because of many tourist attractions such as Big Ben.</p>
        <p class="p2">One thing I don't like about London is constant traffic.</p>
        <p class="p2">I like how diverse London is.</p>
        <p class="p2">Another thing I don't like are the high prices in London.</p>
